## Create React App for my Retail Company

This is one of the major reason I have delved into the world of web development. In this project I plan to build an app that provides all the functionality of an ERP system.

It would a large project that includes functionality for internal staffs to manage business operations and processes. As well, it will include functionality for consumers to view available products, make an order request, and manage their orders accordingly.

Tough day: However, the product search bar now works and filters correctly. Next todo involves:

    1. Adding quantity to the product search bar
    2. Allowing Edit of the already selected product
    3. Allowinbg functionality for deleting selected products

    => Later, the selected product bar should render on the right side of the screen

Lots of bugs in the code that requires some revamp. Now, I have to decide how to fix, especially, if to proceed with other aspect of the project now as stated above, or to:

1. Allocate time to convert the project into a NEXTjs application
2. And also deploy typescript
3. while this might be a good option that would also help me to further break down some of my too large components. I am concern about the time required to implement it at the expense of progress on this project.
4. This also should not neglect the fact that I need to be able to showcase a completed project to my name.
